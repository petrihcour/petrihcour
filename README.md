- 👋 Hi, I’m Vanessa!
- 👀 I’m interested in Dungeons & Dragons, reading, travelling, hiking (when it's not 105 degrees outside), and live music. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering: JavaScript, CSS, HTML ... to be continued. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - unsure. Naive and growing. 
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessa-garcia-322368284/).
